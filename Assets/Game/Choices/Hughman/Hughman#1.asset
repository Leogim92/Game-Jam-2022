  choice2:
    choice: You had me at copulate!

      harm our standing in society and thus our chances of survival.

    choice: "Ah ffs, a furry\u2026"
    response: We are not furry. Our body hair is of the human type and we often shave
      it off, which apparently increases our sexual attractiveness.
